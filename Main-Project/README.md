# Main-Project
Code for the IT-Project in the System Development Course with Kai Spohrer.

**Deliverables**
**1. Access:**
• github repository (working release) + upload source code to canvas

• documentation and instructions

• Jira (& Confluence) repository where you store your project management details that show how you progressed through your sprints (e.g., reviews and retrospectives)


**2. Provide:**
• demonstration video (10 minutes) including technical details

• advertising video (2 minutes) appropriate for marketing to potential customers

• statement of code provenance (in line with copyrights!, usage of tools)

• statement of contribution

• a URL to a running web version of your project
